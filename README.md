$ source bootstrap.sh

Then type `:Lazy` inside NeoVim

## Requirements

### Font

Starship and Neovim require you to [use a nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) 
that understands all the characters being used.

The font I currently use is `Droid Sans Mono for PowerLine` and can be found in 
the [powerline/fonts Github](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/).

### Pokemons

The nvim dashboard also contains pokemons. In order to make these work go visit the [repository](https://github.com/nuke-dash/pokemon-colorscripts-mac)
